Introduction

I am a versatile Node.js backend developer who enjoys the process of building integrated backend systems. My approach towards scalability is that it is facilitated by a culture where information flows freely and where frequent code changes are welcomed.

Achievements

- Created a package that allows all micro services in an e-commerce environment to interact with Azure Service Bus (ASB).
- Implemented validation strategies for different store chains in several different countries running from the same code base.
- Created some tooling for developers to test and develop applications that rely on ASB.
